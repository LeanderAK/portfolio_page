                <h2>Relevant legal bases</h2>
                <p className="color-dark">Relevant legal bases under the GDPR: Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases also apply in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract</li>
                <li>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="color-dark">National data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. The data protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.</p>
                <p className="color-dark">Note on the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss FADP: This data protection notice serves to provide information in accordance with both the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to the broader geographical application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms 'processing' of 'personal data', 'overriding interest' and 'particularly sensitive personal data' used in the Swiss DPA, the terms 'processing' of 'personal data', 'legitimate interest' and 'special categories of data' used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within the scope of application of the Swiss DPA.</p>
                <h2>Security measures</h2>
                <p className="color-dark">We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk. The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, safeguarding availability and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings. Shortening of the IP address: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a full IP address is not required, the IP address is shortened (also known as 'IP masking'). The last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a dot are removed or replaced by placeholders. The purpose of shortening the IP address is to prevent or make it much more difficult to identify a person by their IP address. TLS/SSL encryption (https): To protect user data transmitted via our online services, we use TLS/SSL encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for securing internet connections by encrypting the data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or between two servers). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an updated and more secure version of SSL. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is displayed in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate.</p>
                <h2>Transmission of personal data</h2>
                <p className="color-dark">As part of our processing of personal data, the data may be transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>
                <h2>International data transfers</h2>
                <p className="color-dark">Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognized by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data will only be transferred if the level of data protection is otherwise ensured, in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), express consent or in the case of contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). In addition, we will inform you of the basis for third country transfers with the individual providers from the third country, whereby the adequacy decisions take precedence. Information on third country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission:</p>

                <p className="color-dark">EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: As part of the so-called 'Data Privacy Framework' (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the level of data protection for certain companies from the USA as secure within the framework of the adequacy decision of 10.07.2023. The list of certified companies as well as further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at</p>

                <p className="color-dark"> (in English). As part of the data protection information, we will inform you which service providers we use are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.</p>

                <p className="color-dark">Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:</p>

                <h2>Online marketing</h2>
                <p className="color-dark"> We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include in particular the marketing of advertising space or the presentation of advertising and other content (collectively referred to as 'content') based on the potential interests of users and the measurement of its effectiveness. For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called 'cookie') or similar procedures are used, by means of which the user data relevant for the presentation of the aforementioned content is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times and functions used. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this can also be processed. The IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear user data is stored as part of the online marketing process (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers of the online marketing processes do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles. The information in the profiles is generally stored in cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can generally also be read later on other websites that use the same online marketing process and analyzed for the purpose of displaying content as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing process provider. In exceptional cases, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are members of a social network whose online marketing process we use and the network links the user profiles with the aforementioned data. Please note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g. by giving their consent during registration. In principle, we only receive access to summarized information about the success of our advertisements. However, as part of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to the conclusion of a contract with us. Conversion measurement is used solely to analyze the success of our marketing measures. Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that the cookies used are stored for a period of two years. </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Processed data types:  Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); meta, communication and procedural data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status).</li>
                <li>Data subjects:  Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>

                <li>Possibility of objection (opt-out):  We refer you to the data protection notices of the respective providers and the opt-out options specified for the providers (so-called 'opt-out'). If no explicit opt-out option has been specified, you have the option of deactivating cookies in your browser settings. However, this may restrict the functions of our online offer.

                <h2>Presence in social networks (social media)</h2>
                <p className="color-dark">We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us. We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce users' rights. Furthermore, user data is generally processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are generally stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them). For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the opt-out options, please refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

                <p className="color-dark">We incorporate functional and content elements into our online offering that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as 'third-party providers'). These may be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as 'content'). The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, as they would not be able to send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required to display this content or function. We endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content.

Pixel tags can be used to analyze information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.</p>

                <li>Google Fonts (obtained from Google server): Obtaining fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to topicality and loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible licensing restrictions. The font provider is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) is transmitted that is necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data can be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offering, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e. a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Google Fonts Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and then the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e. the web page on which the Google Font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent and referral URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent needs to customize the font that is generated for each browser type. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are published on the Google Fonts Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregated report on the top integrations based on the number of font requests can be generated. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to create end-user profiles or serve targeted ads; Service provider: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); Website: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">https://fonts.google.com/</a>;  Privacy policy:  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>;  Basis for third country transfer: EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF).
